## What's New in v1.7.0

### 🎨 Dynamic Threshold Colors

All usage bars (Session, Weekly, and Extra Usage) now respect your configured warning and danger thresholds:
- **Green** below warning threshold
- **Amber** at or above warning threshold
- **Red** at or above danger threshold

Changes apply immediately when thresholds are adjusted in Settings.

### 📈 Usage History Graph

A toggleable usage history graph now sits below the main widget. Click the graph button in the toolbar to show or hide it.

![Claude Usage Widget - Graph](assets/screenshot-graph.png)

- Displays up to **7 days** of collected usage data points
- **Data points are captured each time the app refreshes** (every 5 minutes by default when running)
- History **persists across restarts** — collected data is retained when you close and reopen the app
- Sonnet and Extra Usage lines appear automatically when those sections are relevant
- **Adaptive x-axis labels** — shows times for short spans, weekday+hour for medium spans, and dates for longer spans
- Respects your **12h/24h time format** setting
- Hover tooltip shows exact timestamp and value

> **Note:** The graph shows usage snapshots captured at each refresh interval while the app is running. Time periods when the app is closed are not represented on the graph.

### 🌍 Currency Support
The Extra Usage row now displays the correct currency symbol based on your account's billing currency — **€**, **£**, or **$**.

> For full release history, see the [Releases](../../releases) page.

## Installation

### Download Pre-built Release

**Windows:**
1. Download the latest `Claude-Usage-Widget-{version}-win-Setup.exe` (installer) or `Claude-Usage-Widget-{version}-win-portable.exe` (no install needed) from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Run the installer or portable exe
3. Launch "Claude Usage Widget" from the Start Menu (installer) or directly (portable)
4. **To launch at Windows startup (portable only):** Press `Win+R`, type `shell:startup`, and copy the portable `.exe` into that folder. To update, copy the new version in and delete the old one.

**macOS:**
1. Download the latest `Claude-Usage-Widget-{version}-macOS-arm64.dmg` (Apple Silicon) or `Claude-Usage-Widget-{version}-macOS-x64.dmg` (Intel) from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Open the DMG and drag the app to your Applications folder
3. Launch "Claude Usage Widget" from Applications

> **⚠️ macOS Security Notice:** Because this app is not yet notarized with Apple, macOS Gatekeeper may show a "damaged or can't be opened" warning. To fix this, run the following command in Terminal after installing:
> ```
> xattr -cr /Applications/Claude\ Usage\ Widget.app
> ```
> Then try launching the app again.

**Linux:**
1. Download the latest `Claude-Usage-Widget-{version}-linux-x86_64.AppImage` (Intel/AMD) or `Claude-Usage-Widget-{version}-linux-arm64.AppImage` (ARM) from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x Claude-Usage-Widget-*.AppImage`
3. Run it: `./Claude-Usage-Widget-*.AppImage`

> **Note:** AppImage runs without installation on most Linux distributions. On Ubuntu 22.04+, you may need to install a dependency first:
> ```bash
> sudo apt install libfuse2
> ```

#### Linux: Desktop Launcher & Autostart (optional)

By default the AppImage runs from wherever you put it. To get a clickable icon in your app launcher (and optionally launch at login), follow these steps.

**1. Place the AppImage somewhere permanent:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv Claude-Usage-Widget-*.AppImage ~/.local/bin/claude-usage-widget.AppImage
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/claude-usage-widget.AppImage
```

**2. Create a desktop entry:**
```bash
cat > ~/.local/share/applications/claude-usage-widget.desktop << EOF
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Claude Usage Widget
Comment=Monitor Claude.ai usage
Exec=$HOME/.local/bin/claude-usage-widget.AppImage --no-sandbox
Icon=$HOME/.local/bin/claude-usage-widget.AppImage
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;
StartupNotify=true
EOF
```

> **Note:** The `--no-sandbox` flag is required for Electron-based AppImages on most Linux systems due to sandbox namespace restrictions. This is an Electron/Chrome limitation, not specific to this widget.

**3. Register the entry:**
```bash
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
```

The widget should now appear in your application launcher. Test it by launching from your app menu before proceeding to autostart.

**4. Autostart at login (optional):**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
cp ~/.local/share/applications/claude-usage-widget.desktop ~/.config/autostart/
```

## Understanding the Display

### Current Session & Weekly Limit

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Session Used | Progress bar showing usage from 0–100% |
| Elapsed | Circular timer showing how far through the window you are |
| Resets In | Countdown until the window resets |
| Resets At | Actual local clock time / date when the window resets |

**Color Coding:**
- 🟣 Purple: Normal usage (below warning threshold, default 75%)
- 🟠 Orange: High usage (above warning threshold)
- 🔴 Red: Critical usage (above danger threshold, default 90%)

---

## Privacy & Security

- Credentials stored **locally only** using encrypted storage
- No data sent to any third-party servers
- Only communicates with the official Claude.ai API
- Logout clears all session data, cookies, and Electron session storage

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Login Required" keeps appearing** — Session may have expired. Click "Login to Claude" to re-authenticate.

**Widget not updating** — Check internet connection, click refresh manually, or try re-logging in from the tray menu.

**Build errors** — Clean reinstall resolves most issues:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

If issues persist, open a [Support discussion](../../discussions/categories/support) with your OS, Node.js version, and full error output.
